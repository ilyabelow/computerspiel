# Cool and New Geometry Wars

This game is an entry task to the Game Development master program at MIPT. I hope the organizers will find my project cool enough! 

### Requirements

`Engine.cpp` and `Engine.h` files are platform-specific, so you'll need Linux with graphics (obviously)

Build the app with `cmake CMakeLists.txt` and `make`

### Controls

Arrows to move, Mouse to aim, LMB to shoot and click buttons, ESC to pause; when game is over - ESC to exit and Enter to restart


### Notes

The game still needs a lot of balancing and more content would be also great!
